        <p>
          The Nigeria Network of NGOs (NNNGO) is the first generic membership
          body for civil society organisations in Nigeria that facilitates
          effective advocacy on issues of poverty and other developmental
          issues. Established in 1992, NNNGO represents over 3495 organisations
          ranging from small groups working at the local level, to larger
          networks working at the national level.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Network is charged with the objective of identifying, registering,
          coordinating, building capacity and mobilizing civil society
          organisations to promote interconnectivity and bring equity, justice,
          peace, and development to grassroots communities throughout Nigeria,
          including the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals
          (SDGs).
        </p>

        <p className="intro">
          We are a nonprofit organization committed to strengthening the
          capacity of civil society organizations (CSOs) in Nigeria. Our network
          brings together grassroots initiatives, advocacy groups, development
          partners, and nonprofit organizations to foster collaboration,
          accountability, and social impact.
        </p>

        <h3>üë• Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          Founded in 1992, our organization began as a small coalition of NGOs
          seeking to address the fragmented and often under-resourced nonprofit
          landscape in Nigeria. Over the decades, we have evolved into a
          national network representing thousands of CSOs across diverse
          sectors‚Äîfrom education and healthcare to environmental protection and
          women‚Äôs rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that a strong civil society is essential for democracy,
          sustainable development, and social justice. Through partnerships,
          training, policy dialogue, and research, we have helped amplify the
          voices of the underserved and empowered organizations to thrive and
          create long-lasting change.
